# StuffManager
This is my prototype application for android phones. It enables users to create containers with labels, photos and gps location, and items to insert them into the containers. It also enables user to search for and look through all of the items and containers stored.
The code is sometimes not well commented or not so well aligned, but I am working on some new features.
